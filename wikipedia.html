            <p>
                Casimir Jagiellon (Latin: Casimirus; Lithuanian: Kazimieras; Polish: Kazimierz; 3 October 1458 – 4
                March
                1484) was a prince of the Kingdom of Poland and of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Second son of King
                Casimir
                IV Jagiellon, he was tutored by Johannes Longinus, a Polish chronicler and diplomat. After his elder
                brother
                Vladislaus was elected as King of Bohemia in 1471, Casimir became the heir apparent. At the age of 13,
                Casimir participated in the failed military campaign to install him as King of Hungary. He became known
                for
                his piety, devotion to God, and generosity towards the sick and poor. He became ill (most likely with
                tuberculosis) and died at the age of 25. He was buried in Vilnius Cathedral. His canonization was
                initiated
                by his brother King Sigismund I the Old in 1514 and the tradition holds that he was canonized in 1521.
            </p>

            <p>
                Veneration of Casimir saw a resurgence in the 17th century when his feast day was confirmed by the pope
                in
                1602 and the dedicated Chapel of Saint Casimir was completed in 1636. Casimir became a patron saint of
                Lithuania and Lithuanian youth. In Vilnius, his feast day is marked annually with Kaziuko mugė (a trade
                fair) held on the Sunday nearest to 4 March, the anniversary of his death. There are more than 50
                churches
                named after Casimir in Lithuania and Poland, including Church of St. Casimir, Vilnius and St. Kazimierz
                Church, Warsaw, and more than 50 churches in Lithuanian and Polish diaspora communities in America.
                Women's
                congregation Sisters of Saint Casimir was established in 1908 and remains active in the United States.

                <b> Early Life and Education</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A member of the Jagiellon dynasty, Casimir was born in Wawel Castle in Kraków. Casimir was the third
                child and the second son of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV and Queen
                Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria. Elisabeth was a loving mother and took active interest in her children's
                upbringing.[2] The Queen and the children often accompanied the King in his annual trips to the Grand
                Duchy of Lithuania.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p>
                Casimir was a polyglot and knew Lithuanian, Polish, German and Latin languages.[3] From the age of nine,
                Casimir and his brother Vladislaus were educated by the Polish priest Fr. Jan Długosz. The boys were
                taught Latin and German, law, history, rhetoric, and classical literature.[2] Długosz was a strict and
                conservative teacher who emphasized ethics, morality, and religious devotion. According to Stanisław
                Orzechowski (1513–1566), the princes were subject to corporal punishment which was approved by their
                father.[4] Długosz noted Casimir's skills in oratory when he delivered speeches to greet his father
                returning to Poland in 1469 and Jakub Sienienski, the Bishop of Kujawy, in 1470.[4]

                    width="180px" height="180px" style="float: left; padding: 15px;">Prince Casimir's uncle Ladislaus
                the Posthumous, King of Hungary and Bohemia, died in 1457 at the age of
                17, without leaving an heir. Casimir's father, King Casimir IV, subsequently advanced his claims to
                Hungary and Bohemia, but could not enforce them due to the Thirteen Years' War (1454–66). Instead,
                Hungarian nobles elected Matthias Corvinus and Bohemian nobles selected George of Poděbrady as their
                kings. George of Poděbrady died in March 1471. In May 1471, Vladislaus, eldest son of Casimir IV, was
                elected to the throne of Bohemia. However, a group of Catholic Bohemian nobles supported Matthias
                Corvinus instead of Vladislaus II. In turn, a group of Hungarian nobles conspired against Matthias
                Corvinus and invited the Polish king to overthrow him. King Casimir IV decided to install his son,
                Casimir, in Hungary.[citation needed]<br>

                &emsp;Poland amassed an army of 12,000 men, commanded by Piotr Dunin and Dziersław of Rytwiany.[5] Both
                King
                Casimir and Prince Casimir participated in the campaign. In October 1471, the Polish army crossed the
                Hungarian border and slowly marched towards Buda. Matthias Corvinus managed to win over the majority of
                the Hungarian nobles, including the main conspirator Archbishop János Vitéz, and the Polish army did not
                receive the expected reinforcements. Only Deák, Perény and Rozgonyi families sent troops.[6] Upon
                hearing that Corvinus' army of 16,000 men camped outside of Pest, the Polish army decided to retreat
                from Hatvan to Nitra. There the soldiers battled food shortages, spreading infectious diseases, and the
                upcoming winter. The Polish King also lacked funds to pay the mercenaries. As a result, the Polish army
                decreased by about a third.[6] In December 1471, Prince Casimir, fearing for his safety, was sent to
                Jihlava closer to the Polish border and that further eroded their soldiers' morale. Corvinus took Nitra
                and a one-year truce was completed in March 1472 in Buda.[6] Prince Casimir returned to Kraków to resume
                his studies with Długosz.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>Długosz remarked that Prince Casimir felt "great sorrow and shame" regarding the failure in Hungary.[7]
                Polish propaganda, however, portrayed him as a savior, sent by divine providence, to protect the people
                from a godless tyrant (i.e. Matthias Corvinus) and marauding pagans (i.e. Muslim Ottoman Turks). Prince
                Casimir was also exposed to the cult of his uncle King Władysław III of Poland who died in the 1444
                Battle of Varna against the Ottomans. This led some researchers, including Jacob Caro, to conclude that
                the Hungarian campaign pushed Prince Casimir into religious life.[7]</p>

                    width="200px" height="400px" style="float: right;padding: 15px;">
                As his elder brother, Vladislaus II, ruled Bohemia, Prince Casimir became the heir apparent to the
                throne of Poland and Lithuania. Italian humanist writer Filippo Buonaccorsi (also known as Filip
                Callimachus) was hired to become Casimir's tutor in political matters, but his Renaissance views had
                less influence on Casimir than Długosz.[7] In 1474, the Italian merchant and traveler Ambrogio Contarini
                met with Prince Casimir and was impressed by his wisdom. Prince Casimir completed his formal education
                at age 16 and spent most of his time with his father.[7] In 1476, Prince Casimir accompanied his father
                to Royal Prussia where he tried to resolve the conflict with the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia (see War of
                the Priests). In 1478 Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania demanded that King Casimir IV leave either
                Prince Casimir or Prince John I Albert in Lithuania as a regent. King Casimir IV feared separatist moods
                and refused, but after settling the conflict in Prussia, moved to Vilnius.[8]<br>

                &emsp;Between 1479 and 1484 his father spent most of his time in Vilnius attending to the affairs of
                Lithuania. In 1481, Mikhailo Olelkovich and his relatives planned to murder King Casimir and Prince
                Casimir during a hunt at a wedding of Feodor Ivanovich Belsky.[9] The plan was discovered and Prince
                Casimir, perhaps fearing for his safety, was sent to Poland to act as vice-regent. Around the same time
                his father tried to arrange his marriage to Kunigunde of Austria, daughter of Emperor Frederick III. It
                is often claimed that Prince Casimir refused the match, preferring to remain celibate and sensing his
                approaching death.[9] According to Maciej Miechowita, Prince Casimir developed tuberculosis. In May
                1483, Prince Casimir joined his father in Vilnius. There, after the death of Andrzej Oporowski, Bishop
                and Vice-Chancellor of the Crown, Prince Casimir took over some of his duties in the chancellery.[10]
                However, his health deteriorated while rumors about his piousness and good deeds spread further. In
                February 1484, the Polish sejm in Lublin was aborted as King Casimir IV rushed back to Lithuania to be
                with his ill son.[11] Prince Casimir died on 4 March 1484, in Grodno. His remains were interred in
                Vilnius Cathedral, where the dedicated Saint Casimir's Chapel was built in 1636.[citation needed]

                Surviving contemporary accounts described Prince Casimir as a young man of exceptional intellect and
                education, humility and politeness, who strove for justice and fairness.[12] Early sources do not attest
                to his piety or devotion to God, but his inclination to religious life increased towards the end of his
                life.[13] Later sources provide some stories of Casimir's religious life. Marcin Kromer (1512–1589)
                claimed that Casimir refused his physician's advice to have sexual relations with women in hopes to cure
                his illness.[13] Other accounts claimed that Casimir contracted his lung disease after a particularly
                hard fast or that he could be found pre-dawn, kneeling by the church gates, waiting for a priest to open
                them. Zacharias Ferreri (1479–1524) wrote that Casimir composed a prayer in hexameter on Christ's
                incarnation but this text has not survived.[14] Later, a copy of Omni die dic Mariae (Daily, Daily Sing
                to Mary) was found in Casimir's coffin.[15] The hymn became so strongly associated with Casimir that
                sometimes it known as Hymn of St. Casimir and he is credited as its author.[15] The lengthy hymn has an
                intricate meter and rhyme scheme (alternate acatalectic and catalectic trochaic dimeter with internal
                rhyme in the first and third verses (aa/b, cc/b)) and was most likely written by Bernard of
                Cluny.[16]<br><br>

                One of the first miracles attributed to Casimir was his appearance before the Lithuanian army during the
                Siege of Polotsk in 1518. Casimir showed where Lithuanian troops could safely cross the Daugava River
                and relieve the city, besieged by the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[13] Ferreri's hagiography of
                1521 mentions many miracles of Casimir are known but describes only one – a Lithuanian victory against
                the Russians. The description lacks specifics, such as date or location, but most likely refers to the
                Lithuanian victory in 1519 against Russian troops that raided environs of Vilnius, and not the more
                popular story of the Siege of Polotsk.[17]

            <h3>Canonization and official veneration</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Saint_Casimir_from_Vita_beati_Casimiri.jpg/255px-Saint_Casimir_from_Vita_beati_Casimiri.jpg"
                    width="150px" height="200px" style="float: left;padding: 10px;">
                Casimir's official cult started spreading soon after his death. Already in 1501, Pope Alexander VI,
                citing chapel's splendor and Casimir's miracles, granted a special indulgence to those who would pray in
                the chapel where Casimir was buried from one vespers to another during certain Catholic festivals, and
                would contribute to the upkeep of the chapel.[18] In 1513, Andrzej Krzycki wrote a poem mentioning
                numerous wax votive offerings on Casimir's grave.[19] In 1514, during the Fifth Council of the Lateran,
                Casimir's brother Sigismund I the Old petitioned the pope to canonize Casimir.[20] After repeated
                requests, in November 1517, Pope Leo X appointed a three-bishop commission and later sent his legate
                Zacharias Ferreri to investigate.[21] He arrived at Vilnius in September 1520 and completed his work in
                about two months.[22] His findings, the first short hagiography of Casimir, was published in 1521 in
                Kraków as Vita Beati Casimiri Confessoris.[22] The canonization was all but certain but Pope Leo X died
                in December 1521. Research of Zenonas Ivinskis and Paulius Rabikauskas showed that there is no
                documentary proof that he issued a papal bull canonizing Casimir[23] but many important documents were
                lost during the Sack of Rome (1527).[24] The Protestant Reformation attacked the cult of saints and
                there were no new canonizations between 1523 and 1588.[25] However, Casimir was included in the first
                Roman Martyrology, published in 1583.[26]<br>

                The cause of Casimir's cult was taken up by the new Bishop of Vilnius Benedykt Woyna (appointed in
                1600). He sent canon Gregorius Swiecicki to Rome with a letter from King Sigismund III Vasa requesting
                to add the feast of Casimir to the Roman Breviary and Roman Missal.[27] The Sacred Congregation of Rites
                refused the request[27] but on 7 November 1602 Pope Clement VIII issued a papal brief Quae ad sanctorum
                which authorized his feast sub duplici ritu on 4 March but only in Poland and Lithuania.[28] The brief
                also mentioned that Casimir was added to the ranks of saints by Pope Leo X.[28] In the absence of any
                earlier known papal document explicitly mentioning Casimir as saint, the brief is often cited as
                Casimir's canonization.[23][29] Swiecicki returned to Vilnius with the papal brief and red velvet
                labarum with the image of Saint Casimir.[30] The city organized a large three-day festival on 10–12 May
                1604 to properly accept the papal flag. On the third day, the cornerstone was laid for the new Church of
                St. Casimir.[30] The coffin of Casimir was taken out of the crypt and elevated to the altar. Swiecicki
                testified that when the coffin was opened in August 1604 a wonderful smell filed the cathedral for three
                days.[31]<br>
                In 1607 and 1613, Bishop Woyna declared Casimir patron saint of Lithuania (Patronus principalis
                Lithuaniae).[32] The issue of a universal Casimir's feast was not forgotten and in 1620 Bishop Eustachy
                Wołłowicz petitioned Pope Paul V to add Casimir to the Roman Breviary and Roman Missal. This time the
                Sacred Congregation of Rites granted the request in March 1621 and added his feast sub ritu
                semiduplici.[27] In March 1636, Pope Urban VIII allowed the celebration of the feast of Casimir with an
                octave (duplex cum octava) in the Diocese of Vilnius and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[33] That is
                equivalent of proclaiming Casimir as the patron saint of Lithuania. On 28 September 1652, Pope Innocent
                X allowed a fest of transfer of relics of Casimir on a Sunday following the Assumption of Mary.[34] On
                11 June 1948, when many Lithuanians were displaced war refugees, Pope Pius XII named Casimir the special
                patron of Lithuanian youth.[35]
